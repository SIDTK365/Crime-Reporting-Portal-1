- Users can view all of the latest incidents.

- Users can also report their own incidents and the Cyber Cell will take action accordingly.

- Contact information for all cyber cells is available in the Contacts section of the website.

- Users can also gather information about all the cyber laws in the About section.

- Users can also watch awareness videos in the Videos section to educate themselves on Cyber Crime.

## Known Bugs
